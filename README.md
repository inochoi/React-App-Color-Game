# React Color Game

A basic game of guessing a color. The objective of the game is to guess a color that is randomly generated. On each guess, the color square will disappear if color picked is not correct. Upon guessing the correct color, all other squares will reappear with the picked color and the background color will change to the picked color as well. Player will be presented with an option to play again.

The game provides 2 difficulty level settings.

* Easy - 6 color sqaures
* Hard - 12 color squares
